# Welfare Traps in Practice - A New Zealand Perspective

Over the (Northern Hemisphere) summer of 2017, I worked at the New Zealand Labour Party as their only leadership office intern, doing economic analysis. This was election year, and given that Labour was not in office, things were hectic and understaffed. Economic work was done by the Finance Minister, the Senior Economist and me, an undergraduate. It was a fantastic experience, and an extra satisfying one when Labour eventually won the election and put into power the world's youngest female head of government, and the only head of government in modern history to have a child on the job.

Before I arrived, I put together some graphs on the (then) current welfare system in New Zealand. These graphs didn't get used very much, but I think they tell an interesting story, and so thought I would put together a quick write up about what they mean and why they are important.
