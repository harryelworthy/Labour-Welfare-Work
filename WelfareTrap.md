# Welfare Traps in Practice - A New Zealand Perspective
### Harry Elworthy - harryelworthy@gmail.com

Over the northern hemisphere summer of 2017, I worked at the New Zealand Labour Party as their only leadership office intern, doing economic analysis. This was election year, and given that Labour was not in office, things were hectic and understaffed. Economic work was done by the Finance Minister, the Senior Economist and me, an undergraduate. It was a fantastic experience, and an extra satisfying one when Labour eventually won the election and put into power the world's youngest female head of government, and the only head of government in modern history to have a child on the job.

Before I arrived, I put together some graphs on the (then) current welfare system in New Zealand. These graphs didn't get used very much, but I think they tell an interesting story, and so thought I would put together a quick write up about what they mean and why they show problems that are important to any country. They were created in [this messy Jupyter Notebook](WorkingForFamilies.ipynb), so you can follow along with the data there if you want.

This is the most important graph:

* Talk about issue of minimum payment for 20 hour workers
* Talk about issue of phase out - no taxes being paid, but not all income is coming in!
* Compare with below

![Figure 2](INSERT)

* Describe Accom supplement - well meaning, essentially direct transfer to the poor and in need of housing payments. Some ineffiency encouraging people to move to expensive places, but close to what you could consider optimal
* Can see that, while well meaning, increases the effective tax on earners!

* The problem is, with phase outs on top of phase outs, you can get high marginal tax rates, even for people paying no tax.

* This can encourage working less
* Maybe worse, it can discourage people from trying to get promotions or finding jobs with better pay/more hours, as the payoff is not huge. This can keep people in poverty, or close to it

* Other thing interesting - how hard it is to work out e.g. EMTR. No calculator, very tough to work out exactly how much benefit a given person will get, going through multiple agencies etc. The idea is that for a real person doing it, they go to WINZ and get told how much they will get
* The idea is that if people saw that they would earn barely anything for working 5 hours more, they wouldn't work more, and this would do bad things to productivity/etc (?)
* Something sour about policy designed to be opaque 'for the good of the people'
