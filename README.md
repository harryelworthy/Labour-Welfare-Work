## Labour Welfare Work - WIP

The main file here should be [WelfareTrap.md](WelfareTrap.md) which I am currently writing. This draws on the graphs created in [WorkingForFamilies.ipynb](WorkingForFamilies.ipynb), which in turn draws on data in the csv and xls files. More information is included in each of those files.
